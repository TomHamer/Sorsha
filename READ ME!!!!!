I was the sole collaborator on this project, which uses the Parse API simply to manage the server aspect of the code.

The app encompasses two key aspects:

1) An app for use by a customer, intending to order coffee from the LSE Library in London
2) An app for a potential barista, who would fill the orders of the customers

The specification is such that the customer gives a location and the details of the coffee they wish to order. A waiter can then take on an order, order the coffee to the barista, and then run it over to the customer.

In the customer app, use a long-touch to order a coffee. You can sign out of this customer app by going to menu->settings->logout

If you don’t want to use the registration process, you can use the login:

email: tomhamer@live.com
password: asdf

to access the delivery section of the app simply log out from the customer section, go to login, then “login with delivery”. From there, log in with the above credentials.
